Yuri saved my life, okay? Everybody be talkin' about how much they love Yuri these days, but they don't understand I'VE PLAYED THESE GAMES BEFORE! I said I've played these games before! They don't understand. The story begins when I was very young, I discovered Marisa and Reimu. And this ship, this was the beginning of the end, this was a gateway drug as they teach. A gateway drug into the world of Yuri, the addictive world of Yuri. I was hooked. Immediately. I was hooked. And it was already over for me then, it truly saved my life however, it saved me. It saved me, kept me alive on this Earth. The thing is, it all began when I started scouring the internet for any Yuri I could find. And I found it in the places of manga, manga, webtoons, all of those kind. And there's this one in specific on the webtoon, it was a webtoon, a manhwa as they could say, and the thing is, it kept me alive, it truly kept me alive, because... on every Saturday a new episode would be released, a new chapter of this fantasy, this fantasy story, this fantasy Yuri, this fantasy GL. And, it's called Your Throne by the way, I would just be completely and utterly hooked on the story, I would be completely and utterly hooked onto this beautiful fantasy story of two women who are struggling to be in love despite the odds of their brutal fantasy world. And it kept me from thinking about k- it kept me in my deepest darkest moments. It kept me clinging on to a silver of life just holding on and waiting through life, waiting through the week, just one more week so I could hear the following story. So I could continue my Yuri life. And that's how Yuri can truly save someone's life. A story is life-changing. Love is life-changing. And since then, I consumed all kinds of Yuri, I've consumed toxic Yuri, forbidden Yuri, dirty Yuri, clean Yuri, all of that kind. Childhood friends Yuri, enemies to lovers Yuri. All of that, you name it, I've probably read it. Bad thinking diary, all of those by those authors. Lilith! I've read all of them. I've read every- most Yuri you could ever think about. You wouldn't understand, it's a lifestyle. I've spent hours and hours and hours on just looking for Yuri visual novels I could read. Pixiv, hours and hours of Pixiv, even during class, Pixiv-scouring of art like this. Scouring for Yuri fanart on Twitter. Yuri Yuri Yuri Yuri Yuri Yuri. You cannot understand, it is a lifeforce, it is truly a lifeforce inside of you. And, someday, I've even... today, I've even begun to apply what I've learned in these Yuris in my everyday life. It's truly impactful, it changed my life. I've spread Yuri, I've spread Yuri. And in the end, it's become a part of me, it's become a part of me. It's been a part of how I live and how I experience life.
